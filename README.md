# MyFizzBuzz
 
 This is a common JavaScript challenge based on a game from long ago that was designed to help children learn multiples.   When counting from one to one hundred, say fizz for multiples of one number, say buzz for multiples of another number, and say fizz-buzz for multiples of both of those chosen numbers.   
 
 The user fills the two input boxes with a number between one and one hundred and click the button provided.  The print out on screen will be the numbers 1 - 100 with each multiple of your first number replaced with fizz, each multiple of the second with buzz, and of course fizzbuzz for any multiple of both.
